## THREAT MODEL

### Who Are We Protecting Against?

1. **Tier 1: Trackers & Advertisers** (Google, Facebook, data brokers)
2. **Tier 2: ISPs & Governments** (surveillance, censorship)
3. **Tier 3: Threat Actors** (hackers, scammers, competitors)

### What Are We Protecting?

1. **Identity:** Real name, location, financial accounts
2. **Revenue:** Trading strategies, loophole discoveries, tax plans
3. **Operations:** Monolith system architecture, API keys, vault data

## SECURITY LAYERS

### Layer 1: Network Anonymity

#### VPN (Primary Defense)

- **Recommended:** Surfshark, Mullvad, or IVPN
- **Features Required:**
  - Kill switch (auto-disconnect if VPN fails)
  - No-logs policy (verified by audit)
  - Strong encryption (AES-256)
  - Multi-hop (route through 2+ servers)

**Setup:**

```bash
# Verify VPN is active BEFORE starting Monolith
python System/Security/opsec_hardening.py
```

#### Tor (Maximum Anonymity)

- **Use Case:** Accessing sensitive legal/tax research
- **Setup:** Download Tor Browser from torproject.org
- **Trade-off:** Very slow, not suitable for trading

#### Residential Proxies (Stealth Scraping)

- **Use Case:** When Intelligence Layer scrapes data
- **Providers:** Bright Data, Smartproxy
- **Cost:** $10-50/month

---

### Layer 2: System Hardening

#### Windows Debloat

Run this **ONCE** after clean Windows install:

```cmd
Right-click System/Security/windows_debloat.bat
Select "Run as Administrator"
```

**What It Does:**

- ✅ Removes 20+ bloatware apps
- ✅ Disables telemetry (DiagTrack, dmwappushservice)
- ✅ Blocks Cortana, location tracking, advertising ID
- ✅ Cleans temp files and forensic trails

#### Samsung Hardening

1. **Secure Folder:** Move Monolith-related apps here
2. **Debloat:** Use ADB to remove Samsung/Facebook bloat
3. **Firewall:** Use NetGuard (no root required)

**ADB Debloat Commands:**

```bash
adb shell pm uninstall --user 0 com.samsung.android.bixby.agent
adb shell pm uninstall --user 0 com.facebook.system
adb shell pm uninstall --user 0 com.samsung.android.game.gamehome
# ... (50+ more)
```

### Layer 3: Operational Security (OPSEC)

#### Rule #1: VPN-First

**NEVER** start Monolith without VPN active.

#### Rule #2: Burner Identities

- **Payments:** Privacy.com virtual cards (not linked to real bank)
- **Email:** ProtonMail or Tutanota (encrypted, anonymous)
- **Phone:** Google Voice or Burner (not your real number)

#### Rule #3: Metadata Scrubbing

All files generated by Genesis Engine are **automatically scrubbed** of:

- Author name
- GPS coordinates
- Device identifiers
- Timestamps (set to Unix epoch)

#### Rule #4: Air-Gapped Backups

Critical data (vault, ledger.db) backed up to:

- **Primary:** Encrypted USB drive (BitLocker/VeraCrypt)
- **Secondary:** M-DISC (1000-year archival)
- **Never:** Cloud without encryption

---

## KILL SWITCH PROTOCOL

**Emergency Shutdown Trigger:**

- VPN disconnects unexpectedly
- Unauthorized physical access detected
- System compromise suspected

**Automated Actions:**

1. Kill all Python processes (Monolith stops)
2. Kill browser processes (prevent data leaks)
3. Clear clipboard
4. Lock workstation
5. Alert user via SMS (if configured)

**Manual Trigger:**

```cmd
Double-click: KILL_SWITCH.bat
```

---

## ADVANCED: LEVEL 3 (MONOLITH)

### When You're Ready for Maximum Security

#### 1. Switch to Linux

- **Distro:** Linux Mint (beginner) or Arch (advanced)
- **Benefit:** Zero built-in telemetry, full control
- **Trade-off:** Learning curve, some software incompatibility

#### 2. Tails OS (Ultimate Anonymity)

- **What:** Entire OS routes through Tor, leaves no trace
- **Use Case:** Researching sensitive tax loopholes, accessing dark web legal resources
- **Setup:** Boot from USB, all data deleted on shutdown

#### 3. GrapheneOS (Hardened Mobile)

- **Hardware:** Google Pixel 6/7/8
- **What:** De-Googled Android with military-grade security
- **Features:** Panic button (wipe phone instantly), sandboxed apps

#### 4. Physical Security

- **Cameras:** Integrate with Home Assistant
- **Faraday Cage:** Store backup drives here (blocks all signals)
- **Biometric Lock:** YubiKey for vault access

## FAQ

**Q: Is this paranoid?**  
A: No. You're building a money-making AI. You're a target.

**Q: Can I skip the VPN?**  
A: Only if you want your ISP/government to see every trade, every search, every loophole.

**Q: What about Samsung vs. Pixel?**  
A: Samsung Knox is secure but tracks you. Pixel + GrapheneOS is secure AND private. Your choice.

**Q: Is Windows debloat reversible?**  
A: Yes. Re-enable services via `services.msc` and reinstall apps via Microsoft Store.

**Q: Will this slow down my system?**  
A: Opposite. Removing bloat makes it FASTER.
