# Walkthrough - Monolith Global Agentic Factory Upgrade

I have transformed Project Monolith into a **Recursive Agentic Factory**, upgraded to the 2026 "Five Strategic Vertical Pillars" architecture.

## 🚀 Key Upgrades

### 1. The Five Strategic Vertical Pillars

The system is now organized into five specialized "factories":

- **Wealth Factory**: Financial arbitrage, capital allocation, and the new **Accountant Agent**.
- **Security Factory**: PQC (Post-Quantum Cryptography) and network obfuscation.
- **Labor Factory**: Automation of manual tasks and circadian protocol enforcement.
- **Health Factory**: Longevity monitoring and bio-diagnostic auditing.
- **Development Factory**: Recursive system growth and hardware tech-scouting.

### 2. The Accountant Agent (Tax Specialist)

A specialized agent dedicated to 2026 Canadian (CRA/BC) tax landscapes:

- **Slip-Scraper**: Automatically pulls and parses tax slips (T4, T5, T1135).
- **Loophole Scanner**: Identifies BC-specific credits (e.g., Clean Energy Home Upgrade, SBVC).
- **Audit Risk Red-Teaming**: Simulates audit probability to ensure safe but aggressive preservation.

### 3. Recursive Orchestration

The **Master Assistant** now monitors for gaps in these five pillars and can autonomously "manufacture" new sub-agents to fill them.

### 4. Sovereign Command Center (v4.5)

The dashboard has been completely redesigned with a 2026 glassmorphism aesthetic:

- **HSL Status Badges**: Immediate visual feedback on system health.
- **Pillar Overview**: Real-time stats from all five strategic factories.
- **Omega Security Tier**: Verification of encryption and network status.

## 🛠️ Components Created/Modified

- `System/Agents/accountant_agent.py`: The new tax executive.
- `System/Agents/master_assistant.py`: Upgraded to the Pillar Factory model.
- `monolith_dashboard.py`: Rebuilt for the 2026 Director Interface.
- `System/Sentinels/*.done`: Status tracking for all pillar agents.

## 📋 Next Directive

The system is currently in **Simulation Mode** (2026 Context). You can view the results by launching the dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run monolith_dashboard.py
```

Or use the **God Mode Terminal**:

```bash
python monolith_omega.py
```
