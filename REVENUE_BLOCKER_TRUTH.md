## ⚠️ THE ONLY BLOCKER TO REAL REVENUE

**CRITICAL INSIGHT:** The revenue code is complete, but it has NO API KEYS to work with.

### What AI Cannot Do (Human-Only Actions)

1. **Create Grass Account** - Requires email verification + browser extension installation
2. **Create Stripe Account** - Requires business verification + tax documents
3. **Fund Crypto Wallet** - Requires banklink / credit card for gas fees

### Current State of Revenue Streams

| Stream | Code Status | API Status | Revenue Potential |
| ------ | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| Grass (Bandwidth) | ✅ BUILT | ❌ NO ACCOUNT | $60/month |
| Bounty Arbitrage | ✅ BUILT | ✅ READY (No API needed) | $300/month |
| IP Arbitrage | ✅ BUILT | ❌ NO STRIPE KEY | $99/month |
| CEX Trading | ✅ BUILT | ❌ NO CCXT KEY | Unlocks at $100 |
| DeFi Arbitrage | ✅ BUILT | ❌ NO WEB3 WALLET | Unlocks at $1,000 |
