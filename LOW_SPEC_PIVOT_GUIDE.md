# ⚠️ HARDWARE ALERT & REVENUE PIVOT

**System Detected:**

- Processor: Intel Core i3-4170 (Legacy)
- RAM: 4.00 GB (Severe Constraint)
- Graphics: Intel HD 4400 (No Compute Capability)

## 🛑 STRATEGY CHANGE REQUIRED

**You cannot mine on io.net with this specific machine.** (Requires NVIDIA GPU).
**You cannot run Local LLMs.** (Requires 8GB+ RAM).

## ✅ NEW "LOW-SPEC" REVENUE PLAN

We must use this machine for **Bandwidth** and **Lightweight Automation** only.

### 1. Bandwidth Monetization (Best Option)

This works perfectly on older hardware.

- **Grass**: Keep this running 24/7.
- **Pawns.app**: Add this secondary bandwidth seller.
- **Honeygain**: Add this tertiary bandwidth seller.
**Est. Revenue:** $5-10/month (Passive)

### 2. Lightweight "Click" Arbitrage

Since we can't run heavy AI, we hunt for "click" tasks.

- **Micro-Task Scripts**: Automating Swagbucks/InboxDollars searches (requires care).
- **Referral Arbitrage**: Generating referral links for DePIN projects and posting them.

### 3. The "Cloud Brain" Strategy

Since your local PC is weak, leverage the **Cloud**.

- **Google Colab (Free)**: Use this to run the AI agents that need heavy compute.
- **Oracle Cloud (Always Free)**: Host a 4-core, 24GB RAM instance for free.

## 🚀 ACTION ITEMS (For i3/4GB User)

1. **Install Grass Extension** (Already planned).
2. **SKIP io.net** (It will not work).
3. **Sign up for Oracle Cloud Free Tier**:
   - Get a free VPS with 24GB RAM.
   - We will deploy Monolith THERE.

**Current PC Role:** Command Center (Dashboard only).
**Cloud VPS Role:** Heavy Lifting & Revenue Generation.
